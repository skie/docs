    "description": "Most queue systems are great at running independent jobs. You push a job, a worker picks it up, it runs, it's done. This works perfectly until you need jobs that depend on each other. Until you need to process a thousand items in parallel and track when they're all done. Until you need to roll back three completed operations because the fourth one failed.",
